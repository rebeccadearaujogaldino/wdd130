    <p>Hi everyone! I'm not a master at introducing myself but know that I'm trying my very best. :)</p>
    <p>I'm brazilian, married since the end of 2020. I also server a mission in the amazing Japan Nagoya Mission.</p>
    <p>I have quite a few hobbies but my favorite is definitely crafting.</p>
    <p>From that hobby I created my scrunchie's brand called "Florada".</p>
    <p>I'm excited for this new way of creating that programming is showing me. </p>
